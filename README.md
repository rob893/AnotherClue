# AnotherClue
This is a web application that I built for my midterm for my game development class.
This is a riddle based game where the player must answer 5 randomly chosen riddles from a list in a row. Each riddle has a set of 12 images chosen randomly from a set of 20+ images (11 random and the correct answer). The player will never be asked the same riddle twice in the course of 1 playthrough.
